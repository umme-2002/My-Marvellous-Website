                        <p class="main">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight  language. Inside a host environment<br> (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                             connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them
                     <br><br>  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                     <br> operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with 
                     <br>additional objects; for example:</p>
                     
                     <ul class="main"><li>
                         Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object
                         <br> Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                         <br> to user events </li>
                         <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                        <br> running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
                        <br>application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
                        <br>one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on
                        <br> a server.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1 class="main">What you should already know</h1>
                       <p class="main">This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                        <ul class="main">
                            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of 
                            <br>the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

                            <p class="main">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The 
                             <br>   JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            <br><br>checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic 
                            <br>control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                             <br><br>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a 
                             <br>runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
                             <br> string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common 
                             <br>class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
                             <br> what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any 
                             <br>special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely 
                             <br>typed methods.
                             <br><br>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                             <br> variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods 
                             <br>are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                             <br> parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                                        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
                                        <br>called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                                        <br><br>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                                        <br>characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the 
                                        <br>characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                                        <br><br>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also 
                                        <br>use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names
                                        <br> are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                                        You can declare a variable in three ways:
                                         <br><br> With the keyword var. For example,
                                         <br><br>var x = 42.
                                         <br><br>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                                         <br><br>By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                                        <br> x = 42.
                                        <br><br>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning.
                                        <br> You shouldn't use this variant.
                                        <br><br>With the keyword let. For example,
                                        <br>let y = 13.
                                        <br><br>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                                    </p>

                                        <h1 class="main">Variable scope</h1></header>
                                          <p class="main">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                                              <br> available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                                              <br> function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                                              <br>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable 
                                              <br>declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
                                              <br> For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) 
                                              <br>within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                                              <br><br>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                                              <br>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                                              <br><br>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is notif (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                                            </p>

                                        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.
                                        <br> In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                                        <br><br>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                                        <br> window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called 
                                        <br>phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as

                                        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant 
                                        <br>identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar
                                        <br> sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                                        <br><br>const PI = 3.14;
                                        <br>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                                        <br> running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                                        <br><br>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                                        <br> keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                                        <br><br>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.
                                        <br> For example:
                                        <br><br>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                                        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements

                                        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional 
                                        <br>else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                                        <br><br>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                                        <br><br>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation 
                                        <br>of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
                                        <br> otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                                        <br> including further nested if statements.
                                        <br><br>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence,
                                        <br> as follows:
                                        <br><br>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                                         <br>} else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                                         <br><br>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                                         <br> executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) .
                                         <br> In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting
                                         <br> if statements:
                                         <br><br>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                         <br>statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                                         <br>statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                         <br><br>statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                                         <br><br>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
                                         <br> assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, 
                                         <br>do not use the following code:
                                         <br><br>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                                         <br><br>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                                         <br> additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                                         <br><br>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }

                                            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
                                            <br> A while statement looks as follows:
                                            <br><br>while (condition) statement
                                            <br>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes
                                            <br> to the statement following the loop.
                                            <br><br>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                                            <br> statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                                            <br> stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                                             <br><br>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                                             <br><br>Example:
                                             <br>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                                             <br><br>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n / 3) { n++; x += n; }
                                                
                                             <br><br>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take 
                                             <br>on the following values:

                                             <br><br>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
